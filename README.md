tron.py a two player, one keyboard, **command line** clone of the classic arcade game TRON, built using [curtsies](https://github.com/bpython/curtsies).


This game was originally created for intro CS using Zelle's graphics library, graphics.py, and was revised in June 2020 as a command line game to help familiarize myself with curtsies. The old version is preserved as oldtron.py.
