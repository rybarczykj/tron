A two player, one-keyboard clone of the classic arcade game TRON light cylces

Two motorcycles controlled by two different users drive around the playing field,
leaving a trail wherever they go. Each player controls their cycle's direction using 4 keys.
The object of the game is to force your opponent to collide with a wall or trail. 

Player 0 is controlled using WASD
Player 1 is controlled using arrow keys
    Currently player 1 defaults to a bot (still can be controlled by arrow keys but will turn
       automatically under certain context). Be sure to change this if you're gonna play two
       players
