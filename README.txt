A two player, one-keyboard clone of the classic arcade game TRON light cylces

Two motorcycles controlled by two diferent users drive around the playing field,
leaving a trail wherever they go. Each player controls their cycle's direction using 4 keys.
The object of the game is to force your opponent to collide with a wall or trail. 

Player 0 is controlled using WASD
Player 1 is controlled using arrow keys


Libraries:
-all graphics are Zelle's graphics library, graphics.py


Known bugs not yet fixed:

-Game can not take in simultaneous key presses. I believe this is an issue with Zelle's graphics library.
-Game can not understand keyboard input when CAPS LOCK is on.
-Some lag is known to occur, again I think this is Zelle's graphics library
